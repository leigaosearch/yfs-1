Heart Beater
------------

The heart beater in lab 7 works in this scheme:

  * the node with the smallest id pings all of the rest ones
  * other nodes only ping the ``smallest'' node

This approach avoids the n!-magnititude traffic of the naive all-ping-all way. The correctness is also maintained:

  * if the ``smallest'' node fails, there is a fairly large chance that another node will notice this.
  * if any other node fails, the ``smallest'' node figures it out.
