In addition to put()/get(), we have added more interfaces to the
extent_server in previous labs because of efficiency considerations. For
example, pget() only fetches partial data from the specified extent.

This design conflicts with the caching. So we move these operations, such as
pget() and resize(), from extent_server to extent_client.
